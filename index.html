                    <p><em>Experienced Operations Manager and Strategic Analytics Professional</em></p>
                    <p>With a humor-filled heart and an analytical brain, I bring laughter and expertise to any organization. My 10 years of
                        experience in the world of strategic planning, pricing, and analytics has taken me on a journey through tech,
                        operations, health emergency services, private equity, and FMCG. I have a knack for boosting productivity, making
                        sales skyrocket, and launching successful products, all with a smile on my face. My education, including a Master's
                        in Business Analytics & Big Data and an MBA, has solidified my love for business and analytics and given me the
                        foundation to make data dance. When I am not working I am improving my programming skills and when I am not doing that
                        I am either training brazilian jiu jitsu or cooking something over charcoal or wood.</p></td>
